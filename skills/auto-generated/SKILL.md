# Auto-Generated Skills Container

This is the parent skill directory for runtime-synthesized skills. Children appear when `scripts/skill_synthesizer.py synthesize --decision-id X` extracts a successful pattern from `agent_decisions` and renders it as a SKILL.md.

## Lifecycle

1. **`[NEW]`** — child directory created here, frontmatter status set to `[NEW]`
2. **`[VALIDATED]`** — after 3 successful uses tracked in `metrics.json`, `skill_metrics.py promote --skill <name>` moves the child up to `skills/<name>/`
3. **Pruned** — if a `[NEW]` skill goes unused for 30 days, `skill_metrics.py` recommends removal

## Safety

`skill_synthesizer.py validate` rejects auto-generated skills containing destructive triggers (rm, drop, delete, force, send, post, publish, pay) unless the `disable-model-invocation: true` flag is set. CC reviews promotions; auto-promotion is blocked for any skill that touches send_gateway, Stripe, Supabase migrations, or git push.
