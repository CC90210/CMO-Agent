# Codex Delegation — Intelligent Dual-AI Routing

> **Purpose:** Bravo and Codex are complementary AI engines. This skill determines WHEN and HOW
> to delegate work to Codex for maximum leverage — two AIs working in parallel, each on their strengths.

## The Dual-AI Architecture

```
CC → Bravo (Claude Opus 4.6)           CC → Codex (GPT-5.4)
├── Architecture & planning             ├── Backend implementation
├── Frontend & UI                       ├── Deep debugging
├── Creative & brand voice              ├── Adversarial code review
├── Business ops & strategy             ├── Parallel task execution
├── Orchestration & memory              ├── Root-cause analysis
└── Client communications               └── Write-capable rescue tasks
```

## Delegation Decision Matrix

### Auto-Delegate to Codex (No CC approval needed)

| Task Type | Codex Command | Why Codex |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Pre-ship code review | `/codex:review --background` | Second pair of AI eyes catches Bravo's blind spots |
| Architecture challenge | `/codex:adversarial-review` | Questions assumptions Bravo might accept |
| Backend bug with stack trace | `/codex:rescue investigate [bug]` | Codex excels at systematic root-cause |
| Heavy backend implementation | `/codex:rescue --background [task]` | Runs parallel while Bravo does other work |
| Test suite debugging | `/codex:rescue fix the failing tests` | Codex is strong at test diagnosis |

### Keep in Bravo (Never delegate)

| Task Type | Why Bravo |
|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend/UI components | Bravo has better design sense and CC's brand voice |
| Content creation (posts, copy) | Bravo owns CC's authentic voice |
| Business strategy & client comms | Bravo has full business context |
| Memory/state/orchestration | Bravo's infrastructure — Codex has no access |
| Skool/social media automation | Bravo has the MCP and CLI integrations |
| Cross-file sync (brain/, memory/) | Bravo's domain knowledge required |
| Simple fixes (< 3 files) | Delegation overhead > task effort |

### Ask CC (Judgment call)

| Task Type | Why Ask |
|-----------|---------|
| Full feature implementation | Split work or assign to one AI? |
| Refactoring > 10 files | Coordination risk between two AIs |
| Security-sensitive changes | Need explicit human review |

## Parallel Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Review While Building
```
Bravo: Implements feature in frontend
Codex: /codex:review --background (reviews existing changes)
Result: By the time Bravo ships, Codex review is ready
```

### Pattern 2: Dual Investigation
```
Bravo: Debugs frontend rendering issue
Codex: /codex:rescue --background investigate the API timeout
Result: Two bugs investigated simultaneously
```

### Pattern 3: Implement + Adversarial Check
```
Bravo: Writes the implementation
Codex: /codex:adversarial-review --background challenge the caching design
Result: Design validated before ship
```

### Pattern 4: Bravo Orchestrates, Codex Implements
```
Bravo: Creates SPARC spec + architecture (Phases 1-3)
Codex: /codex:rescue implement the backend per the spec in .agents/plans/
Bravo: Reviews Codex output, handles frontend + docs
Result: Full-stack feature with parallel execution
```

## Integration with Task Routing

When the task routing skill (`skills/task-routing/SKILL.md`) classifies a task:

| Complexity | Codex Role |
|-----------|------------|
| TRIVIAL | None — Bravo handles inline |
| SIMPLE | None — single agent sufficient |
| MODERATE | Optional: `/codex:review` after Bravo implements |
| COMPLEX | Recommended: Codex handles backend, Bravo handles frontend/orchestration |
| ARCHITECTURAL | Required: `/codex:adversarial-review` on the architecture before implementation |

## Integration with Ship Pipeline

Add to `skills/ship/SKILL.md` Phase 4 (Code Review):

After Bravo's code review, optionally run:
```
/codex:adversarial-review --background --base main
```

This gives a dual-AI review before shipping — Bravo catches implementation issues, Codex challenges design decisions.

## Pre-Flight Check (MANDATORY before any delegation — added 2026-04-25)

Run this in <2s before spawning a codex-agent. If it fails, STOP — upgrade the CLI first or execute inline. Do NOT burn 5 minutes per agent in a retry loop the way the 2026-04-25 Atlas + Maven session did.

```bash
codex --version 2>&1 | head -1
# Expected: a version string. If "command not found" → install: npm i -g @openai/codex@latest
# If version reported < the one on https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openai/codex → upgrade.
```

Symptoms of a stale CLI (all observed 2026-04-25 with @openai/codex@0.118.0):
- Every model alias (gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4-codex, gpt-5.4-codex-mini, gpt-5-codex, gpt-5, spark, gpt-5.3-codex-spark) rejected by the gateway.
- Codex companion drops into "rescue phase" repeatedly with no progress.
- Total runtime climbs past 3 minutes with no file writes — that's the canary.

Recovery: `npm i -g @openai/codex@latest && node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" status`. If still failing after upgrade, Bravo handles the task inline. Never retry the same prompt 3 times against the same broken CLI — see MISTAKES.md "Codex CLI Stale".

## Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Standard review (second opinion)
/codex:review --background

# Challenge the design
/codex:adversarial-review --background challenge the auth design

# Delegate a task
/codex:rescue --background investigate why the API returns 500

# Quick fix with specific model
/codex:rescue --model spark fix the TypeScript error in api/route.ts

# Check progress
/codex:status

# Get results
/codex:result

# Cancel
/codex:cancel
```

## Context Injection — Giving Codex Codebase Intelligence

Codex runs in the same repo directory but doesn't have Bravo's brain files. When delegating tasks,
**inject relevant context into the task prompt** so Codex makes informed decisions.

### Context Injection Protocol

When building a Codex task prompt, prepend relevant context:

```
<context>
Project: [app name from APP_REGISTRY.md]
Stack: [from APP_REGISTRY.md — e.g., "Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, Stripe"]
Key files: [list the 3-5 most relevant files for this task]
Constraints: [any architectural rules — e.g., "uses App Router, RLS enabled, Stripe webhooks verified"]
Related work: [if Bravo already started something, describe what's done]
</context>

<task>
[The actual task description]
</task>
```

### What to Inject by Task Type

| Task Type | Context to Include |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Backend bug fix | Error message, stack trace, relevant file paths, DB schema if applicable |
| API implementation | Existing route patterns, auth middleware, Supabase table schema |
| Code review | Branch diff summary, what the feature does, any known risks |
| Test debugging | Test framework (vitest/jest), failing test output, related source files |
| Refactoring | Current architecture, files involved, what "done" looks like |

### Example: Delegating a Backend Task

```bash
export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="/c/Users/User/.claude/codex-plugin"
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task --write \
  "Context: Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase with RLS, Stripe webhooks.
   The webhook handler at app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts is not idempotent —
   it processes the same event_id twice when Stripe retries.
   Fix: Add event_id deduplication using the payments table.
   The Supabase client is initialized in lib/supabase/server.ts.
   Constraint: Do not disable RLS. Use the service role key server-side only."
```

## Failure Recovery — When Codex Fails

Codex tasks can fail for several reasons. Bravo must handle each gracefully:

### Failure Types and Recovery

| Failure | Signal | Recovery |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Codex CLI not found** | `setup --json` returns `codex.available: false` | Run `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| **Auth expired** | `setup --json` returns `auth.loggedIn: false` | Tell CC to run `codex login` in terminal |
| **Task timeout** | No result after 15 minutes | Check `/codex:status`, cancel if stuck, retry with simpler scope |
| **Bad output** | Codex returns malformed or empty result | Don't retry blindly — Bravo takes over the task |
| **Codex made wrong changes** | Review shows incorrect implementation | Bravo reverts and handles the task directly |
| **Broker crash** | Session runtime errors | Restart session (SessionEnd + SessionStart hooks will clean up) |

### The 3-Strike Rule

1. **First failure:** Retry with more specific context (inject file contents, narrow scope)
2. **Second failure:** Switch to a different Codex model (`--model spark` for simpler, `--model gpt-5.4-mini` for faster)
3. **Third failure:** Bravo takes over. Log to `memory/MISTAKES.md` with what Codex struggled with.

**Never retry the same prompt 3 times.** Each retry must change something: more context, narrower scope, different model, or Bravo takes over.

### Pre-Flight Check

Before any Codex delegation, verify readiness:
```bash
export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="/c/Users/User/.claude/codex-plugin"
node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" setup --json 2>/dev/null | head -1
```
If `ready: false` — don't delegate. Handle the task directly and note the issue.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

1. **Don't delegate AND do the same work.** If Codex is investigating a bug, Bravo works on something else.
2. **Don't delegate memory/state tasks.** Codex has no access to brain/, memory/, or Supabase.
3. **Don't delegate content creation.** Codex doesn't have CC's brand voice context.
4. **Don't run Codex on trivial tasks.** The startup overhead makes it slower than Bravo for small fixes.
5. **Don't ignore Codex results.** Always present Codex output verbatim to CC.
6. **Don't send vague prompts to Codex.** Always inject codebase context — file paths, stack, constraints.
7. **Don't retry the same failing prompt.** Change scope, model, or context on each retry.

## Maven-specific adaptation

Maven uses Codex for: (1) ad-copy variant generation at scale (50+ headlines/descriptions per campaign for Andromeda diversity), (2) attribution math (LTV/CAC, multi-touch, last-non-direct vs data-driven), (3) A/B test significance calculations, (4) landing-page copy A/B variants, (5) competitive ad-library transcript analysis. Maven NEVER delegates brand voice or strategic positioning to Codex — those stay in Maven. Delegation routes through `scripts/codex_delegate.py` which wraps the codex-companion.mjs CLI.
